PARATHYROID HORMONE

PTH
Enhanced chemiluminiscence
Comments
Parathyroid hormone PTHJis a single chain 84 amino acid polypeptide produced by the parathyroid gland. After
PTH is secreted into he blood slream it undergoes extensive proteolysis to generate various fragments In
contrast to its degradation products the concentration of Intact PTH is relatively independent of glomerular
filtration rate and refelcls the biologically active portion of the hormone
Guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry recommend the use of intraoperative parathyroid
hormone testing for patients during surgery for hyperparathyroidism . especially in minimally invasive or directed
procedures as well as for patents undergoing reoperation
For pateints undergoing parathyroidectomy it Is
recommended that preoperative and pre-excision samples are Iaken Samples should also be drawn at 5 and 10
minutes post resection ad a
50 reduction in PTH levels from the highesl baseline may be used as criteria for
surgical success
Test results should be interpreted in conjunction With serum calcium and phophorus levels and clinical finding
As per KDIGO guidelines. the PTH concentration of patients treated by dialysis should be maintained within two
to nine times the upper normal limit of the assay VIDAS PTH interval in such patient is 89.2
