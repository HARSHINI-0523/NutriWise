Interpretation
Serum transferrin and TIBC high. seruin aron low
saturation low
Usual causes of depleted tron stores Include blood
mnadequate dletary 1ron RBC In mnoderately severe 1ron
deficiency are hypochronic and ncrocytic Stauable marrow Iron 1s absent Seruin ferritit decrease Is the earlest Indicator of tron deficiency If Inflammatin 1s absent
Anetia of chrontc dtsease Serutn transferrmn and TIBC low t0 normal

saturatmn low
or normal Transferrut decreases WIth many Inflammatory diseases With
chrontc dtsease there Is a block 1nl movement t0 and Utilization of tron by marrow
This leads t0 low serum 1ron and decreased erythropolesis Exarnples Inlclude acute and chronic
infections . mahgnancy and renal fatlure

Protemn depletion
Serum tratsferrin and TIBC mnay be low
serum Iron normal or low If patient also IS tron deficient This mnay occur as a result of malnutrition. hver disease . renal
disease
Liver disease
Serum transferrin variable. WIth acute viral hepatits. high along WIth serum Iron and ferritin
With chronic ltver disease eg. cIrrhosus transferrin may be Jow Patients who
have cirrhosis and portacaval shunting have saturated TIBC ItransferTin aS Iell as hugh ferritin
