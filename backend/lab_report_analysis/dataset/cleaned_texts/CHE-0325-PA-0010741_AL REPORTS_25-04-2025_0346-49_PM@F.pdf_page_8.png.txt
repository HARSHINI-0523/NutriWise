Method
End-point Colorimetric Dual wavelength
BILIRUBIN INDIRECT.Serum

Method
End-point Colorimetric Dual wavelength
Remark
Disclaimer
On Vitros Dry chemistry as per the method instructions .since Total
Direct and Indirect bilirubin are measured independently It can mean
that sum of direct bilirubin and
Indirect bilirubin may not be exactly equal to Total bilirubin result: The normally expected variability In the
independent
measurements of Tbil. BU Indirect . BC Direct will occasionally produce
sum of BU BC that
be slightly greater
slightly less than upto /-0.3mg/dl the TBII. even when the true concentrations of
Bu Bc and tbil are Identical. Conjugated Blirubin in
plasma reacts to form the bllirubin-albumin conjugate called
as delta bilirubin
Delta bilirubin remains elevated for
longer duration. Delta
bilirubin remains elevated
after biliary obstruction IS cleared. Kindly correlate clinically
