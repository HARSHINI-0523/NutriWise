C-reactive protein CRP is a important and evolutionarily ancient component of the Innate Immune response: CRP has been described as
the prototypical acute-phase reactant to Infections and Inflammation in human beings.
In the cllnlcal setting CRP is used as a clinical
indicator of acute Infections and response to treatment and to assess inflammatory status in chronlc diseases. Initially it was thought that
CRP might be a pathogenic secretion as it was elevated in people wlth a variety of Illnesses
including cancer: However. discovery of synthesis
in the lver demonstrated that it is manufactured by the human body:
The fact that CRP is a independent predictor of stroke and coronary artery disease but also a
contributor to effective bacterial
clearance. underscores the importance of microbes In the pathogenesls of these dlseases: Some patients On the Marshall Protocol MP
